  <h1 style="text-align:center";>Symmetric Guess who?</h1>
  <br><br>
</header>

<body>
  <p>In the game of guess who, two opposing players pick a character from a given
  set of characters. The characters that players can choose have various
  attributes such as the colour of hair or wearing glasses. It is up to players,
  to guess what character his or her opponent has chosen in order to win the game.
  Players may ask binary questions about the attributes in order to gain
  informatiom on which characters the opponent may, or may not have chosen.</p>

  <p> The variant that is analysed here is symmetric Guess who. Here, once a
    player asks a question about an attribute, both players have to say whether
    or not their character satisfies the mentioned attribute (truthfully).
    The implications of the symmetric gameplay is that players may be unable to
    ask direct questions when it would reveal which character they are playing
    themselves. Thus, as a player, you need to have information on what your
    opponent knows about your character. It may even help to know what your
    opponent thinks you are going to do next.

  <h2>Using epistemic logic:</h2>

  <p>
    The game is analysed here using epistemic logic. We use the knowledge operator
    K to represent what knowledge is held by each player. A Kripke model in S5 is
    shown below. Each world consists of a pair of characters such that each player
    has chosen a character. Since each player knows what character they have,
    they know which characters they do not have. Therefore, e.g. player 1 can only
    access worlds where the character for player 1 is the same as the one he
    chose. This means that worlds have connections to each other world where the
    local state is preserved, much like the distributed systems used by ?????.
